   opencsv-2.2.jar      Custom CSV handler


Notes:

   -Source data file can be retrieved from:

      https://data.cms.gov/Medicare/Inpatient-Prospective-Payment-System-IPPS-Provider/97k6-zzx3

      and specifying "Export - Download as CSV"

   -To make the Eclipse projects work, the above source file needs to be
    copied to the input directory of that project (not done in the tar files
    here to save space).

   -A custom jar handling CSV input was downloaded from:

      http://www.java2s.com/Code/Jar/o/Downloadopencsv22jar.htm

    This was used to properly handle the fields within the data file that
    are surrounded by quotation marks and contain commas within them.

    This jar file is already copied in the lib directory of the project
    tar files.
